This Jekyll blog theme is based on a github repository by Dave Liepmann [here](https://github.com/daveliepmann/tufte-css), which in turn was based on the [R Markdown Tufte Handout](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/examples/tufte-handout.pdf). I borrowed freely from Dave's repo and have transformed many of the typographic and page-structural features into a set of custom Liquid tags that make creating content using this style much easier than writing straight HTML. Essentially, if you know markdown, and mix in a few custom Liquid tags, you can be creating a website with this document style in short order.
